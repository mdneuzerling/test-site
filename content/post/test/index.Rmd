Hello, this is a test post.

```{r}
print("This is an R chunk")
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

The below recreates the above R chunk, but with a Python list instead of an R vector. We can see that the input for the list appears as `NA` in the markdown file, although the output is unaffected.
```{python}
print("This is a python chunk")
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The below contains a single line of bash: `echo 'This is a bash chunk'`. Again, the input is `NA`, but the output is unaffected.
```{bash}
echo 'This is a bash chunk'
```
